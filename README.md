### Overview
This code is submitted for CV project.
This is a Keras port of the SSD model architecture introduced by Wei Liu et al. in the paper [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).

The original code was cloned from https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* TensorFlow 1.x
* Keras 2.x
* OpenCV
* Beautiful Soup 4.x

##What does the code do
The code can train and evaluate several models on several datasets, I have used the models to train and evaluate parts of ICUB Dataset, each file contains a self explanatory comments(both the cloned files and the files that I have added) 

the following Google Drive folder conatins all the supplementary materials ( Models, Dataset parts, test results, graphs)

##Models:
I provide all the models I have trained using both Nivida Quardo P5000 and Nvidia GTX 950M:
SSD300_ICUB_7, SSD512_COCO_ICUB_6(fine tuned), SSD7_ICUB_6,SSD7_ICUB_4,SSD7_ICUB_20_INSTANCE_DETECTION
as well as MS_COCO resampled weights used to initialize ssd512 training, and VGG-16 feature extraction weights trained on ImageNet.

##Dataset Parts
the described (in the document) datasets, which contain the training images and annotations with the list of train/val, along with the test images and annotations with the list.
most dataset parts contain two test modalities: using unseen images from seen instances, and images from unseen instances.

##Test results
are npz files generated by python scripts, containing the test results.
the notebook: test_result_viewer can be used to re-generate mAP tables and Precision-recall graphs for these results.

##graphs
the graphs generated for the tests in a jpg format
##ICUB Dataset
